# Weather Forecast Application

This application provides a 7-day weather forecast based on location data retrieved from the browser. It utilizes a Java backend built with the Spring Framework and a TypeScript frontend using React.js. The backend communicates with an external weather API provided by [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch weather data based on the user's location input. The fetched data, including date, weather code, minimum and maximum temperature, and estimated energy generated by solar panels, is then sent to the frontend for display.

## Features

- **Location-based Weather Forecast**: Users can input their location, and the application retrieves a 7-day weather forecast.
- **Interactive Map**: The frontend features an interactive map where users can click to select a location, updating the weather forecast for that area.
- **Integration with External API**: Utilizes the [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API to fetch weather data.
- **Dark mode**: Dark mode toggle is positioned in the top-left corner.

## How it Works

1. Location data is provided by user's browser.
2. Backend processes the location data and sends a request to the Open Meteo API to fetch weather forecast data.
3. The fetched data is then formatted and sent to the frontend.
4. Frontend components receive the weather data and update the user interface accordingly.
5. Users can interact with the map to select different locations and update the displayed weather forecast.
